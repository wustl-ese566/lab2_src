## Discription
This code is for Lab 2 of class ESE566A Modern System-on-Chip Design, Spring 2017, Washington University in St. Louis.

### Task 1
Given the fixedlatency multipler and onecycle multipler, you should design your own pipelined multiple.
The file multiplier.v in pipelined folder is the template for your design.

### Task 2
Use design compiler to compile all three multiplers and place and route in encounter. Then in your report, compare the power, area, timing and other facts that you think are important of these different multipliers and briefly explain the result. It is better to visualize your experimental results(tables and/or plots).
